# Hierarchical_Clustering
# **Project Title**:-
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers" of american mall market called PHONIX Mall.To find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basics of prediction of Annual Income vs Spending Score
# Problem statement:-
The American Finance Market Clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 who has highest no_of growth in their business market.
As a data science engineer find out which hierachy cluster use maximum linkage in upcoming future

# TASK-1:
Import the library and dataset
# TASK-2:
Using the dendrogram to find theoptimal no_of clusters
# TASK-3:
reate a hierachy model and visualize the clusterwith help of matplot.lib library

# CONCLUSION
According to  the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster no-3 has the highest no_of linkage
